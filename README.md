Simple Text Replacement Program

Rename the .txt file to 'replacement.txt' 

Keys and phrases are separated by a ':'

Example: '.cat:dog' - The key is '.cat' which will be replaced by 'dog' 

Currently there can be no spaces between lines in the .txt file or it will return an error. 
The program searches keyboard strikes, so this will work anywhere that you are typing: Internet browswer, Word Doc, Email, etc.
